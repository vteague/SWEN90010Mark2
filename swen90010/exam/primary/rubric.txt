Question 1 [13 marks]
---------------------

(a) Three inputs failure [2 marks]
(b) Calculate status failure [1 mark]
(c) Voting failure [1 mark]
(d) Correct identification of necessary events [2 marks]
(e) Correct identification of sufficient events [2 marks]
(f) Good justification of (d) and (e) [2 marks]
(g) Correct breakdown [1 marks]
(h) Joules "output" failure [1 mark]
(i) Correct syntax [1 mark]

Question 2 [12 marks]
---------------------

[6 marks]
(a) Correct preconditions (both operations) (1 mark)
    Correct adding/removing of messages to queues -- including per process ID (2 marks)
    Correct compositions (2 marks)

[6 marks]
(b) Correct way of calculating expected parity (1 mark)
    Elegant solution for calculating expected parity (1 mark)
    Correct comparison of real and expected parity (1 mark)
    Other correct (process ID, removing message, etc) (1 mark)
    Correct preconditions (1 mark)
    Correct composition (1 mark)

Question 3 [8 marks]
--------------------

1. Fault detection: 
   + Both can detect faults [2 marks]
   + N=3 can detect 2 faults, while N=2 can only detect 1 [1 mark]

2. Fault tolerance:
   + N=2 cannot tolerate faults [1 mark]
   + N=3 can tolerate at most one fault [1 mark]

3. Voting systems: 
   + N=2: cannot use any voting system, because no majority can be reached [1 marks]
   + N=3: median and majority can be used [1 mark]
   + N=3: k-plurality with k=2 [1 mark]


Question 4 [6 marks]
--------------------

The correct answer should be:

11111000-0010

So the 2nd parity bit is incorrect. As such, P1 is the faulty bit.

(a) State that there is an error [1 mark]
(a) Calculate the correct parity code [2 marks]
(c) Find the bit in error [2 marks]
(d) Good working [1 mark]

Question 5 [1 mark]
-------------------

Ada Countess of Lovelace. First computer programmer. [1 mark]

Question 6 [11 marks]
---------------------

(a) Note that the program does NOT establish contract [1 mark]
(b) Correct proof that precondition implies weakest precondition [1 mark]
(c) Correct application of loop rule [1 mark]
(e) Correct proof that loop invariant is maintained [1 mark]
(f) Correct proof that loop invariant implies weakest pre of remainder (NOT postcondition) [1 mark]
(g) Correct application of branch rule [2 marks]
(h) Correct application of sequence rule throughout [2 mark]
(i) Correct application of array rule [1 mark]
(j) Good working [1 mark]
