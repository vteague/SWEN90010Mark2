This directory contains the latex source of the course notes for
SWEN90010: High Integrity Systems Engineering

The notes are divided into several chapters. Each chapter is contained
in a sub-directory, and pulled together in the file
"course-notes.tex". To build the notes, type 'make'.

Each chapter directory also contains a makefile for building that
individual chaper. The file that pulls together the chapter is
chapter-X.tex, where 'X' is the chapter number.

To include files in a chapter, use the format:

 \input{\rootdir/chapter-directory/path-to-new-file}

The tag '\rootdir' is set in course-notes.tex and chapter-X.tex
respectively, and is used so that chapters can be built individually,
and the notes can be built together. The reason for this is that Latex
includes files relative to the path from where the 'latex/pdflatex'
command was run.
