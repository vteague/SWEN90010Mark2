Project outline:

CARA pump system.

Four components:

- Blood-pressure monitor
- Pump system
- CARA decision making system
- patient?

System level:

- three modes: wait, auto, manual -- switch between
- start/stop monitor/pump
- if auto or wait => increase/decrease target rate (by 5 mmHg)
- if manual => update mmHg amount

CARA decision making system:

- if 2 successive readings missed => alarm
- amount calculated from average of 5 sec intervals
- titrate is maintained: default 70 mmHg
- target flow rate for 70 mmHg is 4 L/hour

Pump:

- issue specified amount at L/Hour
