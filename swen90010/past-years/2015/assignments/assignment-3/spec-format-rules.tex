\section{Specification format rules}
\label{app:spec-format-rules}

Like code,  the layout of code has a strong influence on its readability. As such, you are expected for format your specification well using the following rules:

\begin{itemize}

\item Every axiom or schema must contain a comment at the beginning explaining its behaviour. In particular, any assumptions should be clearly stated.

\item Constants and variables must be documented.

\item Variable names must be meaningful.

\item Significant parts of operation schemas or schema declarations must be commented.

\item Consistent indenting must be used; e.g. variable declarations and predicates must be indented from the schema name declaration.  

\item Lines must be no longer than 80 characters. You can use the Unix command ``\texttt{wc -L *.sum}'' to check the maximum length line your Sum file.

\end{itemize}
