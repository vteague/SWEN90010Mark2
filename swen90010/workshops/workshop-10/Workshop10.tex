\section{Week 10 Workshop: }
\subsection{Byzantine Agreement}
Byzantine Agreement requires $t+1$ rounds and a total of at least $3t + 1$ nodes to tolerate $t$ traitors.  Assume that the general begins by giving the order, but then behaves like an ordinary participant for the rest of the protocol.
\begin{enumerate}
\item In class we covered the Exponential Information Gathering (EIGByz) Algorithm, for Byzantine failures.  Think of an example with 2 traitors and 4 honest participants in which the honest participants do not agree, even though they follow EIGByz correctly.
\item We also covered a simpler version of Exponential Information Gathering appropriate for Authenticated Byzantine Agreement (slide~18).  Give an example with two traitors in which the honest participants do not agree after $t$ rounds, even if they follow  this simplified EIG algorithm exactly.  Explain why all honest participants must agree after $t+1$ rounds.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Message Authentication and Hashing}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf The ``birthday paradox''}  Let $H$ be a hash function that outputs a $k$-bit digest.  (Assume for simplicity that it's a single-block hash function with fixed-length inputs that are also $k$ bits.  It doesn't really matter though.)   You are trying to generate collisions by guessing.  Show that after guessing about $2^{k/2}$ different input values, the probability of having found at least one pair of different values $A$ and $B$ with $H(A) = H(B)$ is about 50\%. 

(Hint: For small $x, e^{-x} \approx 1-x$.  Bigger hint: see Paar and Pelzl's texbook, Ch~11.)

This is an important result, and the main reason that recommended hash lengths tend to be double the recommended symmetric-encryption key lengths.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Applications}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Randomised partial checking}  Suppose two adjacent mix servers $A$ and $B$ shuffle and rerandomise some encrypted values, and an independent (trustworthy) party verifies their correctness using randomised partial checking.  Each ciphertext of $A$'s output, which is also $B$'s input, is randomly selected to have either its source or its destination revealed, each with probability $1/2$.  (Suppose also that each proves that no two outputs derive from the same input, and no two inputs are linked to the same output---see the paper by Juels, Catalano and Jakobsson if interested.)  
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $A$ substitutes one input, what is the probability that it gets caught?
	\item If $B$ substitutes $k$ outputs, what is the probability that it gets caught?
	\item If $A$ and $B$ collude together and substitute $k$ inputs and $k$ outputs, can they do so stupidly so they are guaranteed to get caught?  
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
