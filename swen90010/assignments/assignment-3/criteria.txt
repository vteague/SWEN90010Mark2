Assignment 3 marking
====================

Alloy model: /12
================

Alloy model of ICD operations: /6

 Here, we will assess only the *updated* specifications

 + Correctness and correctness: /3

   3 marks: All operations are modelled corectly and all considerations have been met.
   2 marks: Minor problems from above. We can be picky here: they have Alloy to help them, so our expectations should be high
   1 marks: Some cases not considered or are modelled incorrectly.
   0 marks: No solid attempt made.

 + Abstraction and modelling /3

   3 marks: A clear and succinct solutions
   1-2 marks: Some parts difficult to understand
   0 mark: Horrible... just horrible!

Security implications: /4

  Assess the security implementations. Here, the students should have identified *at least* two implications. We'll awards marks for the best two.

  Some security implications to consider to check:

    1) A person cannot be their own cardiologist or clinical assistant.
    2) A patient cannot read or update the settings.
    3) A clinical assistant cannot update the settings.
    4) If a person is both the cardiologist and clinical assistant for a particular ICD, then they can still update the settings.
    5) Only an authorised cardiologist or clinical assistant can switch between modes

  4 marks: 2 marks for each security implication, broken into:

    a) 1 mark for a correct and 'reasonable' implication, where 'reasonable' is one of the four above, or some other implication that is sensible -- judgement is required here.
    b) 1 mark for an Alloy assertion that correctly and completely models the desired property that should hold, given the implication.

Updated model: /2

    2 marks: The updated model correctly addresses the implication, and as a result, the assertion identified above holds.
    1 mark: The model does not address it correctly, but does a reasonable job. 
    0 mark: Way off the mark.  

Fault-tolerant design: /8
=========================

 + Architecture /3
 + Algorithms /2

   5 marks: The architecture are algorithms together mitigate all of the issues identified by the HAZOP where appropriate; e.g. most security issues cannot be mitigated, but tolerating calculation errors and hardware failures can. The algorithms chosen (e.g. voting algorithms) are suitable given the hazards and the architecture chosen. We should be looking at least for:

    1) 3 heart monitors.
    2) 3 implementations of algorithm to determine the amount of shock to deliver for tachycardia
    3) 3 implementations of algorithm to calculate the average heart rate over 6 beats for determining whether the heart is in fibrillation.
    4) multiple impulse generators are fine, but ONLY if they also have a corresponding way of detecting whether the impulse has been delivered; e.g. measurement of the heart beat at the time of delivery; otherwise, it is just furphy

   3-4 marks: Some hazards not addressed when they could be, or some redundancy opportunities missing. Algorithms incorrect or not clearly identified.

   1-2 marks: A design that is ill-suited to address the hazards, or that fails to address many of the hazards that could be reasonably addressed.

   0 marks: Poor attempt at a fault-tolerant design.

 + Justification /2

    2 marks: Clear and convincing justificiation.
    1 mark: A weak justification, or one that does not relate the choices back to the hazards identified.
    0 marks: No convincing justification.

 + Requirements /1

    1 mark: New requirements address the fault-tolerant aspects and are sensible, and no unnecessary requirements. Part marks for unclear requirements.

Total: /20
